  { name: "Colchuck Lake", coordinates: "47.5277, -120.8210", length: 8.0, elevation_gain: 2280, highest_point: 5580, description: "The first time you round the corner and come out of the trees at Colchuck Lake is something of a religious experience. Suddenly, laid out beneath your feet are the icy waters of the lake–-deep blue in the shade, bright aquamarine in sunlight–-while high above you at the far end of the lake, the twin spires of Dragontail and Colchuck Peaks seem to crowd out the very sky.

  And all this is within relatively easy reach. While the final ascent to the lake is steep and rough in places, Colchuck’s overall elevation gain of 2,300 feet makes its spectacular scenery accessible to hikers of almost any ability. In summer, cars fill not only the trailhead parking lot, but the road leading to it. As if Colchuck Lake alone weren’t enough of a draw, it is one of the two gateways to the Enchantments, and the trailhead also accesses Stuart Lake, an easier and equally awesome destination.

  Begin on the Stuart Lake Trail #1599. The first mile and a half climbs very gradually in forest, first dense and dark, then thinner and lighter, within earshot and sometimes sightline of Mountaineer Creek. Occasional breaks in the trees offer glimpses of the steep walls of the valley.

  At the end of this first mile and a half, the trail crosses to the right bank of Mountaineer Creek on a sturdy log bridge. On hot days, standing at the midpoint of the bridge, hikers can catch some welcome relief from the breeze coming off the rushing whitewater of the creek. After the bridge, the route steepens and grows rockier, a small taste of what’s to come over the hike’s second half.

  Three quarters of a mile later, the trail flattens out and drops a little before reaching a trail junction. Straight ahead the path to Stuart Lake rolls out, while the Colchuck Lake Trail #1599.1 breaks off to the left. Follow the trail to the left and after a short stretch in the trees, come to another log bridge that takes you across a narrow, turbulent section of Mountaineer Creek. The trail is a bit of a jumble as you hop boulders in a large talus slope along the creek’s bank. A short distance later you near the creek again, but here its waters turn suddenly glassy smooth; a nice spot for a meditative pause before starting to climb once again.

  At first, the trail switchbacks gently, but the closer it gets to the lake, the steeper and rockier it gets. At several spots along the way, views open up, first to the valley you’ve just climbed out of, then up to the toothy ridge of Dragontail Peak. After one final steep stretch, the trail takes a jog to the right, drops into a small swale and suddenly, there you are at one of the finest lake views in the Cascades.

  The trail seems to end at a broad granite face overlooking the lake. This is a great place to grab lunch and take in the scenery. Immediately across the lake is the imposing massif of Dragontail Peak. To the left of Dragontail is Aasgard Pass, the climb that serves as the unbelievably steep “shortcut” to the Enchantments. To the right are the remnants of the Colchuck Glacier and the slopes of Colchuck Peak, its true summit tucked out of view behind rocky towers.

  The trail continues along the lakeshore another two thirds of a mile, at times rough and a little hard to follow. One of the least obvious route junctures is at a large tarn -– it’s a common mistake to follow the well-trodden dirt to the right, but the trail actually proceeds over rocky slopes to the left. After a series of bends and ups and downs in the trees, the trail reaches a rock field at the bottom of the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier. Here, subalpine firs give way to larches, and the formal trail gives way to a rock-hopping route that eventually heads up Aasgard Pass.

  WTA Pro Tip: There are campsites all along the lakeshore, but be aware that camping here is managed under the same strict regime as the core Enchantment Zone -– overnight stays are by permit only from June 15th-October 15th.", parking_pass: "Northwest Forest Pass", image: "http://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/image.jpg-2/@@images/4623cf4d-e206-4253-94cc-b04ba9911e2b.jpeg"},

This area seems to be a haven for the serpents, so be careful while trekking through the brushy canyons. The snakes hole up when the temperature drops, so restrict your visits to autumn through spring and you'll have no worries about vipers. While the snakes dig in, the other animals come out in the cooler temperatures. Coyotes and jackrabbits play out their life-and-death dance here. Mule deer browse on the rich foliage. Badgers burrow in the sandy banks along the canyon walls.

From the creek crossing, hike north on the railroad grade. In just 0.7 mile, you'll encounter an old fence line and decrepit watering troughs. These relics create a very rustic Old West feel. Here you'll turn west and climb along a dirt road angling up a side canyon on the eastern flank of Badger Mountain. After another mile or so of steep climbing, the road veers left (south) and tops out on the highlands above Douglas Canyon. Use the various jeep tracks that cross the terrain to explore a mile or more along the highlands with their stunning views before returning the way you came.", parking_pass: "No", image: "http://www.wta.org/site_images/trip-reports/2010/badger-mtn-view.jpg/@@images/1aab63ec-71eb-470f-b2ca-34782ecb703c.jpeg" },
  { name: "Ozette Triangle: Cape Alava - Sand Point Loop", coordinates: "48.1536, -124.6679", length: 9.4, elevation_gain: 300, highest_point: 350, description: "th sea stacks, sea otters, sea lions, and ocean scenery for as far as you can see, the 9.4-mile Ozette Triangle is one of the finest hikes on the Olympic Coast. Easily accessible and a loop hike, the Triangle (named for the loop's shape) is a perfect introduction to America's wildest coastline south of Alaska. You won't be alone on this section of wilderness beach, however, for Ozette's admirers are legion. But there's plenty of room, and if you venture this way on a winter weekday you might just find yourself alone with the harlequin ducks.

From Lake Ozette, one of the largest natural bodies of freshwater in the state, the loop begins its 3.3-mile journey to the sea. Cross the lazy and brackish Ozette River on an arched bridge, coming to a junction in 0.25 mile. Take the trail right (the left trail is your return route), proceeding through a thick forest of western cedar and Sitka spruce. Most of the way is via a cedar-planked boardwalk, convenient for traversing the saturated terrain but slippery during periods of rain. The Park Service has begun replacing many of the rotting cedar planks with nonslippery plastic ones.

Continue through lush maritime forests drenched in sea mist. Towering ferns line the elevated path, and in early spring the boardwalk is lined with thousands of nature's lanterns: blossoming skunk cabbage. At 2.25 miles pass through Ahlstroms Prairie, an early homestead site long-since reclaimed by the dense greenery that thrives in this waterlogged climate.

Raucous gulls and the sound of crashing surf announce that the ocean is nearing, and at 3.3 miles a slight descent delivers you to the wild beaches of Cape Alava. Now for real fun! Turn south and follow the shoreline for 3.1 adventurous miles. Look out to offshore islands. Search the ocean waters for seals, whales, and scores of pelagic birds. Look in tidal pools for semisubmerged starfish tenaciously clinging to barnacle-encrusted walls. Look for oystercatchers cruising down the aisles of this open fish market. Look up in the towering trees hugging the shoreline for perched eagles.

Search for Makah petroglyphs etched into the Wedding Rocks, a cluster of shore-hugging boulders about halfway along the coast. Respect these historic and sacred artifacts, which predate European settlement in the Northwest. If the tide is low, continue along the surf. If it is high, use the steep but short trails (signed) that bound over rough headlands. Continue on wide beach and approach another spot that may require a detour if the surf is high.

At 3 miles from Cape Alava and after 6.3 miles of hiking, you'll arrive at Sand Point. Over 2 glorious miles of some of the finest sandy beaches in all of Washington extend south from this point.

When you must relinquish this heavenly environment back to its rightful owners-the seals, oystercatchers, otters, and sanderlings-return to Lake Ozette via another 3-mile-long boardwalk trail through expansive cedar bogs and under a dense canopy of majestic Sitka spruce. The sound of the surf slowly fades in the distance, but the Ozette Triangle will chime in your memories for quite some time.", parking_pass: "National Park/Refuge Entry Fee", image: "http://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/sand-point-elwert.jpg/@@images/bae0f8bf-2767-4627-aa34-7ad1ba92ee9e.jpeg" },
  { name: "Granite Mountain", coordinates: "47.3979, -121.4860", length: 8.6, elevation_gain: 3800, highest_point: 3800, description: "The astounding views from the summit of the Granite Mountain trail come at a price. A nearly-1000-feet-of-elevation-gain-per-mile price. But views of pointed Kaleetan Peak, deep blue Crystal Lake, the climber-dotted Tooth, and Mount Rainier dominating the skyline to the south make it all worth it.

Begin at the Pratt Lake trailhead in cool, mossy forest, where you hike along a wide, moderately-graded tread. On the way to the junction for Granite Mountain Trail, a large switchback offers views straight up a steep, debris-filled avalanche chute. This is evidence of a real danger in the winter and early spring; hikers without avalanche gear are better off waiting until the snow has melted down before tackling Granite.

After 1.2 miles, arrive at the junction. Here the Pratt Lake trail continues on a moderate grade via the left fork, but your vertical adventure is just beginning. Granite Mountain Trail heads off to the right.

After the junction, the trail narrows and becomes rockier, so watch your step as you continue hiking through quiet forest. While it may be shady, it's unlikely you'll be chilly. The steep grade will keep you warm as you follow narrow switchbacks up, up, up.

Just under a mile from the junction, cross the avalanche chute you peered up near the beginning of the trail. A seasonal stream runs down the chute and early in the season you can replenish your water supply from it, but don't forget to filter! Continue past the chute and traverse eastward, up onto the shoulder of Granite Mountain. When you break into high meadows, the steep grade lessens. Catch your breath and scan the horizon. How many of the summits can you identify?

After orienting yourself, press on. The trail becomes increasingly rock-laden, slowing your pace as you clamber up and around large boulders. It's here that you realize just how appropriate Granite Mountain's name is. Fortunately, the views are gorgeous and huckleberry bushes line the trail. In late summer, the berries provide a rejuvenating snack. A switchback in the trail reveals the lookout that is your destination, but don't be fooled. From your first sighting of the structure it's still a mile to the summit.

The trail progresses north, with the lookout on your left. Leave the fields of huckleberries and follow the narrow, rocky trail through the bottom of a basin. Enjoy the easiest part of this hike, a jaunt through a green alpine meadow bordered by a talus slope to the south. The final push is a grunt, but the views! Break out above treeline onto a talus field, and marvel at the lookout perched on the rocks. Further afield, Mount Stuart and the Teanaway are visible to the east, Rainier commands your view to the south, and if it's a clear day, you can make out Baker floating on the northern horizon.

WTA Pro Tip: The Granite Mountain Lookout can accommodate a relatively small number of people. During the summer and especially on weekends, Granite Mountain can have as many as 100 hikers at its summit, so please be courteous to fellow hikers and limit your time spent exploring the lookout if there is a ranger at the summit who has opened it to the public.", parking_pass: "Northwest Forest Pass", image: "http://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/granite-mountain-1.jpg/@@images/0bfd084a-f124-4707-8176-03a668f2a3c4.jpeg" },
  { name: "Blanca Lake", coordinates: "47.9154, -121.3124", length: 7.5, elevation_gain: 3300, highest_point: 4600, description: "Visit one of the most striking lakes in the Henry M. Jackson wilderness. The vibrant blue of the glacier-fed lake provides the perfect rest stop for hikers who have braved the thirty-odd, steep switchbacks that lead to the lake.

The trail starts in cool second growth forest, but the trees are quite sizable. In the fall, the squirrels roughhouse in the trees high above your head. Occasionally they drop gigantic pinecones from high above, and while the resulting crash is startling, it is fun to watch.

The trail is in excellent shape, and gets right down to business, starting off venturing through a close forest with very little understory, but lots of moss. As you climb, you move swiftly from one steep but well-designed switchback to another, and yet another, gaining a little under 3,000 feet in a little under 3 miles.

While this can be draining, rewards await you at the top. Huckleberry bushes line the trail, and tired hikers can stop and munch on the sweet treats their their heart's content. After three miles, the trail reaches a ridgeline with a set of switchbacks heading up a rocky face. If you look to the east, some stellar views of the mountains can be seen, and on a clear day Glacier Peak graces hikers with an up-close and personal view.

Once you've conquered the ridgeline, most of your climbing is over. The trail continues much more gently through sub-alpine flower meadows that glow with lupine when in season. Eventually, the trail drops to pretty but stagnant Virgin Lake. There is no inlet or outlet, so the water is entirely snowmelt and rainwater, and by late fall the water is more like a bog. Often, this is a breeding ground for frogs and salamanders, so keep your eyes peeled for plenty of amphibian friends.

WTA trail crews have had backcountry response teams (BCRTs) working to improve this section of trail for three summers, but use caution in wet weather as small sections can still be muddy, rocky, rooty, and steep, dropping 600 feet in 0.6 miles.

If you can tear your eyes away from the trail, the view will take your breath away. Across the valley is the foot of Columbia Peak, and ss you round the last point, beautiful Blanca Lake opens up in all her glory. The lake is framed to the north by the peaks of Monte Cristo, Columbia, and Keyes. More than a few hikers have been known to gasp aloud when they round the corner and see the robin-egg blue waters.

Above the lake, the Columbia Glacier drains via a twin waterfall into the vibrantly blue colored water. It's the glacial till in the water that lends the lake its otherworldly color. At at the end of the trail lies a small beach full of driftwood, perfect for relaxing and enjoying the beauty that surrounds you.

Here pikas and marmots abound, watching like sentinels from large boulders fallen from the peaks high above.

WTA Pro Tip: Blanca Lake is an extremely popular trail. If you decide to visit, you can enjoy a quieter destination by heading for Toil Peak, attainable from the saddle just above Virgin Lake. Instead of heading downhill toward Virgin and Blanca Lakes, head up and west for views of Glacier, Kyes and Monte Cristo Peaks, as well as Blanca Lake's robin-egg blue glowing in all its glory.", parking_pass: "Northwest Forest Pass", image: "http://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/blanca-lake-by-opus.jpg-4/@@images/ebe1023b-2252-4ce9-9b44-3aef74de4ac6.jpeg" },
  { name: "Bandera Mountain", coordinates: "", length: 8.0, elevation_gain: 3400, highest_point: 5240, description: "Bandera Mountain is a chameleon. Most would describe it as an easy hike--relatively short and not very steep for most of its length–-but then it suddenly changes, turning informal and rough, particularly in its last half mile, making it feel like the rugged backcountry trek it at times can be.

Start out on the Ira Spring Trail. The parking lot will likely be full if you come here on a nice weekend day. Not only is Bandera a popular hike, but it shares a trailhead with the equally popular trails to Mason Lake and Mount Defiance. For the first mile and a half, it is gentle and wide as it follows an old road bed (about halfway through this first section, a water crossing may be somewhat difficult during times of heavy runoff). The trail departs the old road and heads more steeply uphill. Occasional breaks in the trees enable partial views of Rainier to the south.

In another mile and a quarter, after a series of looping switchbacks, the trail to Bandera and the trail to Mason Lake part company as the way to Bandera heads straight uphill through a meadow of beargrass and bleached stumps of trees burned in a fire long ago. The next fifth of a mile is steep –- in fact, one of the steepest stretches of trail you’ll find, gaining one foot of elevation for every two feet it travels. The saving grace for those not used to this sort of climbing is that it is mercifully brief and boasts firm footing in the form of numerous rocks and boulders.

The trail soon reaches a ridge and heads east along it. At times, it becomes somewhat difficult to follow as it enters minor rock fields, until reaching Little Bandera, technically a false summit. The vast majority of people turn around here after pausing to picnic among the blocky granite and stunted firs. There is nothing false about the views-–this spot provides an excellent vantage of the ridge and meadows to the south, as well as across I-90 to nearby peaks like McClellan Butte and the ubiquitous Rainier. Turning around here gives you a round trip hike of 7 miles, with about 2850 feet of elevation gain; perfectly respectable for a day hike.

If you must press on to the true summit, know that the trail gets hard to follow. It drops steeply over the rocks of Little Bandera’s summit and is barely visible. You'll lose and then regain elevation as you follow the ridge. Few people venture out this way–-Bandera Mountain's actual summit is forested and holds no real attraction save for the glory of reaching a summit less than 100 feet taller than the false summit you just stood on.", parking_pass: "Northwest Forest Pass", image: "http://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/bandera-mtn.jpg-2/@@images/0adc5435-de12-47b5-94ed-124ff864bdb3.jpeg" },
  { name: "Cascade Pass and Sahale Arm", coordinates: "48.4755, -121.0750", length: 12.0, elevation_gain: 4000, highest_point: 7570, description: "In Sahale Arm, the forces of nature have conspired to create an improbably gentle, gorgeous landscape at an elevation where it seems as if there should be only rock and ice. Instead, a scenic trail ambles peacefully through rolling alpine meadows blanketing the broad shoulder of Sahale Mountain. This park-like setting is made all the more spectacular by contrast with the dramatic mountainous terrain that stretches off in every direction near and far.

Begin by following the Cascade Pass trail. From Cascade Pass, the trail heads north (left when arriving at the pass) and switchbacks its way up a steep slope. In early summer, it is a sea of glacier lilies; in fall, it is covered in mountain blueberries. In amongst the shrubs and wildflowers here, a population of marmots-unofficial ambassadors of Sahale Arm–begin a welcome that continues for much of the hike. Lumbering through the meadows, they seem not only unconcerned by the hikers passing through, but intent on entertaining them.

Approximately three quarters of a mile from Cascade Pass, the trail crests a rounded shoulder at 6,000 feet in elevation and emerges suddenly to an awesome sight: Sahale Mountain and its eponymous glacier. Shimmering silver ribbons of meltwater snake their way down the precipitous slopes of the mountain some 3,000 feet to Doubtful Lake, tucked just out of sight.

The trail heads left, offering peeks at Doubtful Lake below. The next fifth of a mile is mostly flat, a gentle stroll through heather before turning right towards Sahale Mountain. Though seeming to make its way gradually through small groves of trees, the trail climbs quite steeply around the bend before once again attaining the ridge. To the left, views open up to the unforgiving terrain of Boston Basin. Peaks with names like “Forbidden” and “Torment” tower above the Quien Sabe (“Who Knows”) Glacier. Further off in the distance, Mount Baker, Shuksan and Eldorado dot the skyline.

After another half mile, the trail once again levels out as it passes the occasional tarn and outcroppings of granite set amongst windblown grass. You could be forgiven for feeling as if you’ve been transplanted to the Scottish Highlands.

Enjoy this section while it lasts. In another fifth of a mile, the trail pitches upward again through a rutted, muddy section along a quietly cascading stream. The trail doesn’t let up again until it reaches the Sahale Glacier Camp, a collection of flat spots ringed with rocks piled up against the wind. The final half mile climbs sharply over scree and rock.

Some of the campsites sit on the very edge of the terminal moraine of the glacier. The views are simply amazing. From here, you can see beyond the peaks of Cascade Pass to an endless procession of mountains such as Formidable and Spider. To the east, Sahale connects to Buckner Mountain, and beyond sit Storm King and Goode, the tallest summit in North Cascades National Park. In fall, Sahale Arm itself is the best part of the vista, as the meadows turn a brilliant shade of rust-red.

As if there weren’t enough to draw you here already, Sahale Arm is also a reliable place to spot bear. An impressively large black bear with a glossy coat has been repeatedly spotted meandering across Sahale Arm and occasionally down to Cascade Pass.

The bear knows what many a hiker does as well: of all the many incredible places in the North Cascades, this may very well be the finest to wander through.

WTA Pro Tip: Camping in the Sahale Glacier Camp requires a backcountry permit, available on a first-come, first-served basis at the ranger station in Marblemount.", parking_pass: "No", image: "http://www.wta.org/site_images/trip-reports/2015/tripreport.image.2015-09-03.0973733555/@@images/423f4e87-c340-48ff-b2ed-4677160e1252.jpeg" },
  { name: "Mount Dickerman", coordinates: "48.0538, -121.4900", length: 8.2, elevation_gain: 3950, highest_point: 5760, description: "Nestled deep in the heart of the Mountain Loop, Mount Dickerman offers superb views of all the major peaks that make up this ring of awesome summits. It’s a fine mountain in its own right too; you’ll ascend nearly 4,000 feet on your way to the top.

This is a three-season trail. In late fall, before snow closes the Mountain Loop Highway short of the trailhead, it makes a spectacular snowshoe route. In late spring and early summer, it is the quintessential view hike. And in late summer and early fall, it offers a treasure trove of plump blueberries.

Start out at the parking lot Dickerman shares with the Perry Creek trailhead. Large as the parking lot may be, it fills to capacity and beyond on sunny weekends. For the first two or so miles, the trail switchbacks through dense forest. The first part of the trail is enlivened by the occasional rocky outcropping and a spot or two where fallen trees practically form a roof over the trail. After those first two miles, breaks in the forest canopy begin offering up tantalizing views of nearby peaks, like Big Four and Vesper.

In another two thirds of a mile, the trail breaks out into the open for a brief series of quick switchbacks before it dives north and heads into a mostly flat section. With the exception of a few zig zags, the trail heads almost straight ahead as it traverses a broad shoulder from the southeast flanks of the mountain to the peak’s west ridge. Unless it hasn’t rained in a very long time, the flat terrain and exposed terrain combine with spring runoff to make for a muddy half of a mile.

The trail hits the ridge and stays at or near it for a while. Where it intersects the ridge, be sure to stop and enjoy the views to the north. Particularly striking is the view up the ridge to the cliffs of Dickerman’s summit, hanging high above the Perry Creek drainage. After a third of a mile, the trail heads east, away from the ridge and out into the open, south-facing slopes below the summit.

Here, fields of blueberries bask in the sun, making it one of the first places in the Cascades where this scarce crop fully ripens.

The trail resorts once again to switchbacks on its steady climb through the meadows, with a brief pause for a side trail to a vantage point with direct views of the summits of Gothic Basin and Monte Cristo. In another third of a mile, you reach the summit ridge.

Several groves of trees force a bit of a choice here: stay below the summit and gaze south or stand on the very top and gaze north. There is no bad decision, since views to either direction are spectacular.

The summit drops away sharply to the north into the adjacent valleys between Stillaguamish Peak, Mount Forgotten and Twin Peaks. The occasional mountain goat may play peekaboo from the rocky ledges below the summit, but be careful when playing along; the north side of the summit is nothing but a sheer dropoff.

Looking back to the west and north, you can scan through all the major peaks of the northern Mountain Loop: Three Fingers, Whitehorse, White Chuck, Pugh and Sloan, while Baker, Shuksan and Glacier Peak hover above and seemingly just beyond. On your way down, the visual trek continues through Monte Cristo, Del Campo, Morningstar, Sperry, Vesper, Big Four, and Pilchuck.

With the possible exception of Hidden Lake Lookout, this is the finest summit view around--a rare chance to get so close to so many other summits at the same time. Mount Dickerman may have asked a lot of you to get here, but it will have more than held up its end of the bargain.", parking_pass: "Northwest Forest Pass", image: "http://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/dsc_0019.jpg/@@images/2c999230-9016-41fd-bd15-60b6f17500bb.jpeg" },

Here you can bear left for Summit Lake or right for Bearhead Mountain. Bearing right, continue on trail 1179 along the western edge of Bearhead Mountain.

Emerge from an old growth forest to peek-a-boo views of Mount Rainier and large meadows. In the spring and summer, enjoy a variety of wildflowers including beargrass, paintbrush, and lupine, as well as blueberry picking. Fall colors are a spectacular display early in the fall season.

To hike the lower section of the Lewis River is to step into a different world, populated by fantastic patches of old-growth fir and cedar in a shadowy section of the Gifford Pinchot. Its easily accessible location and fairly flat riverside route make it a perfect early-spring hike. Throw in a few waterfalls, wildflowers and a variety of ancient forest pecularities — including pinesap, coralroot and gnome plant—and you have an outdoor discovery destination suitable for the whole family, even Fido.

From the trailhead parking area, first head downstream a few hundred yards to viewpoints of cascading Curly Creek and Miller Creek Falls, which will whet your appetite for what's yet to come. Retrace your steps and head upstream, where old-growth Douglas-fir and western redcedar draped with angel hair, reach skyward, while mossy nurse logs occupy the forest floor with their fledgling new growth.

The Lower Lewis River Falls are spectacular. At a 43 feet high and 200 feet across, they are larger in person than photos may lead you to believe. On the left side is a churning trough which gathers most of the water flow, and there are several viewpoints to capture the scene from.

Look for carpets of vanilla-leaf here and there, and the bright white blooms of early season trillium swaying to and fro. Notice the gigantic stumps where giants once stood, the almost spongy wood a brilliant reddish color against the greens of the forest.

Another mile and a half upstream lie the Middle Lewis River Falls, a river-width combination of a waterfall and a cascade of water sheeting along bedrock. The viewpoints are limited here, but even the riverbed is pretty, the clarity of the water revealing its ragged volcanic nature. A short side trail up to Lower Copper Creek Falls brings hikers to a small trickle of water that drops 32 feet in a classic formation.

Carry on, and at 2.5 miles find the Bolt Camp Shelter, a neat place to spend a little time pondering the history of this now quiet area. Continuing upstream, the forest becomes sprinkled with a smaller mix of trees. You will shortly arrive at the very impressive Upper Lewis River Falls. Again, photographs do not do this area justice. The falls are 58 feet high and 175 feet across. Have lunch at the river's edge below the falls and enjoy the view, as well as the cool breeze drifting off of the moving water.

Taitnapum Falls lies a short distance further up the trail, so curious hikers can continue on. But a surprise waits for you before reaching Taitnapum; about a quarter mile beyond the lower viewpoint is another viewpoint of the Upper Lewis River Falls. It requires a steep uphill climb, but is worth the effort.

Taitnapum Falls drops only 16 feet across the 60 foot width of the river. Its most noteworthy feature is the raggedness of its lip. Most waterfalls course over a well-rounded lip, but not Taitnapum. Its lip has resisted wearing evenly, leaving a bizarre ragged undercut edge for the water to spill over.

Turn around here, or continue the remaining one third of a mile to the Quartz Creek Trailhead, where you can embark on another adventure, or turn around and head back to your starting point at the Lower Falls Recreation Area.", parking_pass: "Northwest Forest Pass", image: "https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/lewis-river-falls_cliff-birdsall.jpeg/@@images/47eadbd3-ffac-4daa-ad9b-7db857c9b930.jpeg" },

At this point it seems amazing to think you will be up there by the end of your hike, but a look at a trail map will reveal some well-engineered switchbacks -- courtesy of many WTA work parties -- that will get you to your destination with less effort than you might expect. The old trail to the summit was in bad shape from heavy use and no maintenance, but WTA work parties helped create this beautiful avenue through second-growth forest to the rocky ledges. In addition to adding a half mile to the old trail, the steepness was lessened a bit.

From the parking lot, head to a gate on the southeast side of the lake and follow a short service road about a quarter-mile to the trailhead. There you will find porta-potties and a very informative kiosk with maps, trail information and history of the area. To the right is the well signed trailhead. Begin hiking here.

After about a hundred feet you will be met by a greeter boulder, the first of many of these mossy monsters you will encounter along the lower section of the trail. As you ascend the trail and gain elevation, there will be a few places where you can look down on Rattlesnake Lake and appreciate your progress. At 1.9 miles you will reach a signed junction; though it is not signed, Rattlesnake Ledge is just to the right, about a hundred yards away.

The ledge is a very exposed, large rock that has sheer cliffs, so it would be wise approach slowly if you are hiking with kids or dogs.

If you wish to extend your trip you can go back to the junction where the sign points out the trail to East Peak 2.4 miles away, or the ridge traverse to Snoqualmie Park, 8.3 miles away. You can also go just a short way from the junction up to Middle Ledge and Upper Ledge which are usually much quieter and afford more sweeping views to the northwest, where you can look down on the crowds at Rattlesnake Ledge.

  { name: "Gothic Basin", coordinates: "", length: 9.2, elevation_gain: 2840, highest_point: 5200, description: "Gothic Basin will thrill and enthrall those who pay the admission. Day hikers will wish they’d brought their tents and bags and the backpackers will ache from shouldering the load. But neither will be disappointed. Be wary of this trail's apparently lowish elevation gain and mileage. The miners who constructed it had little time for switchback or nicely graded trails.

It is quite steep at times and even includes a scramble or two. Steep sections remain snow-covered late into the season, and once it begins to melt out, snow bridges appear. Note also that depending on how far you wander once you arrive in the basin, your total mileage may vary from what is posted here.

Hiking from Barlow Pass, the first mile passes gently along a now-closed road that parallels the Sauk River. The significant washout that prompted a reroute several years ago is no longer an issue, so the trail parallels the mighty river. Hike along the road for about a mile before coming to a section where water runs over the road. You should see two bridges in the distance. Here, a trail veers off to the right, straight into the woods. Keep an eye out for an outhouse when you get onto the trail. This is your last best bet for relief before the hike hits the exposed talus fields that characterize the upper section of the trail.

After an easy half-mile of forest rambling, Weeden Creek must be crossed. Take a moment to appreciate a scenic waterfall here--the trail begins climbing steadily as soon as you make the crossing. The business of ascending begins in earnest after Weeden Creek, with intermittent views and creek crossings. Several spots along this trail require light scrambling over frequently wet rocks.

Take your time and enjoy the views, both micro and macro. The peaks of the Monte Cristo area loom off to your left. Some mining remnants remain, and crazy abundances of wildflowers choke the trail well into the end of July. Snow crossings also last until late in the season. As always, caution should be exercised as the trail can be blocked or made difficult to navigate by avalanche run-outs late into the season.

Gothic Basin itself is a special place which deserves much respect. Melting ponds, gurgling brooks, chirping marmots, and towering rock faces greet you in every direction. The temptation is to wander aimlessly. Instead, remember the Leave No Trace principles and confine your travels to durable surfaces such as rock and snow. If you’re looking for Foggy Lake, head to the right following periodic cairns and the most prominent footpath. Allow yourself extra time to find the path and to appreciate the natural beauty surrounding you.

WTA Pro Tip: If you’re camping, allow lots of time to find a campsite. This is a popular camping destination and the campsites are not obvious. You’ll also want a bear can, as there are not any trees in Gothic Basin suitable for a bear line.", parking_pass: "Northwest Forest Pass", image: "https://www.wta.org/site_images/hikes/dscn0448.jpg/@@images/018573db-f2e9-4b91-a763-4de192720e69.jpeg" }

  { name: "Ada Lovelace", location: "London, England", bio: "British mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.[1][2][3]

Lovelace was born 10 December 1815 as the only legitimate child of the poet George Gordon, Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke, Baroness Wentworth.[4] All Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women.[5] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later, eventually dying of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Ada's mother remained bitter towards Lord Byron and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing what she saw as the insanity seen in her father, but Ada remained interested in him despite this (and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request)." },
